This method can be used to see if a number is divisible by 3, 5, 7 or a combination of either depending on the number passed into the method! 

- Entering a number that has a factor of 3 will return Pling!
- Entering a number that has a factor of 5 will return Plang!
- Entering a number that has a factor of 7 will return Plong!
- Entering a number with a combination of factors will return a longer String i.e. 3 and 5 will return PlingPlang!
- Entering a number that does not contain one of the factors will return the original number!

It comes with a large amount of paramterised test, using both method and value sources to pass in multiple values - these will check if the value inputted returns the correct String!
